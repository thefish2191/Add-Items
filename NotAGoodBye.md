I'm glad you are here! That means a lot to me, because that means that I created something that you find useful.

I created this extension because I was tired of having to write every single class, enum, struct, etc. myself, the language I use the most is C# and this extension was originally designed for it, then I realized that I could use it for other languages as well, so I added support for other languages.

That is the very reason I decided to create a better version of this extension, I wanted to make it easier to add support for other languages, and I wanted to make it easier to add new templates. It wasn't easy, honestly, but I think I did a good job.

Because of this, I decided to move on and create a new repository, new extension and a new name for it. Also, I decided to move it to a new organization, so I can have more control over it.

## What will happen to this old extension?

I decided to remove it from the marketplace, because I don't want to have "duplicate" extensions, and I don't want to have to maintain two extensions, so I decided to remove this old one and keep only the new one. However, if you still want to use the old one, you can still download the code and compile it yourself.

I hope you enjoy this extension, and if you have any suggestions, please let me know, I'm always looking for ways to improve this extension.
