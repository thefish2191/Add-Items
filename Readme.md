Create files, classes, enums, scripts, json, XML or any other for your favorite programming language.  
Use the templates given or create your own!

## How to use

Once the extension is installed on `vscode`, create items using the context menu:

![addItemCtx](Resources/Readme/AddItem-Context.gif)

Or run the command: `add-items: Add item` if you are into shortcuts

![addItemCommand](Resources/Readme/AddItemCommand.gif)

A shortcut is already provided for you: `Ctrl + win + /` for default items, and `Ctrl + win + \` for custom items.  

You can also create an item from the welcome page, in the `new file...` menu
